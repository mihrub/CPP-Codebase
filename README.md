## C++ Learning Repository

Hi, I’m **Mihrub Aziz Bhuiyan**.  
This repository contains all of my C++ practice codes — including basic concepts, STL usage, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

I started my programming journey with **C++**, and this language helped me to build a strong foundation in problem solving and low-level concepts.

## 📌 About This Repository

In this repository, I have dumped all my learning and practice codes related to:

- Core C++ basics  
- C++ Standard Template Library (STL)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Problem-solving practice (basic to some advanced level)

This repo mainly reflects my learning process while growing as a beginner programmer.

## 📂 Topics Covered

- Basic syntax and control statements  
- Functions and recursion  
- Arrays, strings, and pointers  
- STL containers and algorithms  
- Classes and objects  
- Constructors and destructors  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Operator overloading and other OOP concepts

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is:

- To keep all my C++ learning in one place  
- To track my progress in programming  
- To revise important concepts easily  
- To build a strong base before moving to other languages

## 🧠 Learning Note

C++ taught me many low-level and core programming ideas such as:

- memory handling  
- performance awareness  
- logical problem solving  

I solved many basic problems and also explored some advanced concepts during this journey.
