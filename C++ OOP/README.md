# C++ OOP – Complete Review

This folder contains my complete practice and revision of
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

It covers all major OOP concepts, pillars, access control, and object life cycle.

---

## 📌 What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming approach where we model real-world entities using objects and classes.

OOP helps in:
- better code organization
- reusability
- maintainability
- scalability

---

## 🧱 Pillars of OOP

---

### 1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation means binding data and functions together inside a class.

Main idea:
- data is hidden
- accessed using public functions

Why used:
- protects data
- controls how data is modified

Example concept:
- private data members
- public getters and setters

---

### 2. Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.

Why used:
- reduces complexity
- improves clarity for the user of a class

In C++ it is achieved using:
- abstract classes
- pure virtual functions

---

### 3. Inheritance

Inheritance allows one class to acquire properties and behavior of another class.

Why used:
- code reuse
- logical relationship between classes

Types commonly used:
- single inheritance
- multilevel inheritance
- hierarchical inheritance

---

### 4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means one interface, multiple behaviors.

Two main types:

✔ Compile-time polymorphism
- function overloading
- operator overloading

✔ Runtime polymorphism
- function overriding using virtual functions

Why used:
- flexible and extensible design

---

---

## 🔐 Access Modifiers

### public
- accessible from anywhere

### private
- accessible only inside the class

### protected
- accessible inside the class and its derived classes

Why access modifiers are important:
- data protection
- proper encapsulation

---

---

## 🏗️ Constructors

Constructors are special member functions that run when an object is created.

Types covered in this folder:

### ✔ Default constructor
- called when no arguments are passed

### ✔ Parameterized constructor
- used to initialize objects with values

### ✔ Copy constructor
- used to create a new object from an existing object

Why constructors are important:
- proper initialization
- resource handling

---

---

## 🧹 Destructor

Destructor is called when an object is destroyed.

Why used:
- to release memory
- to clean up resources

---

---

## 🔁 Function Overloading

Multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists.

Used for:
- better readability
- logical grouping of operations

---

## 🔄 Operator Overloading

Allows operators to work with user-defined objects.

Why used:
- natural and readable object usage

---

---

## 🔗 Inheritance & Virtual Functions

Virtual functions enable runtime polymorphism.

Why important:
- correct function call using base class pointer/reference

---

---

## 🧠 Important OOP Concepts Reviewed

- class and object
- constructors and destructors
- this pointer
- static data members and functions
- const member functions
- virtual and override behavior
- base class pointers
- dynamic binding

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- To fully revise C++ OOP before exams and interviews
- To clearly understand all OOP pillars
- To practice real usage of classes and inheritance
- To build a strong object-oriented foundation for future languages like Java
